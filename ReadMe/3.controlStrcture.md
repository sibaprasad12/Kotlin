# Control Structures
## If Expression  
- In Kotlin, if is an expression, i.e. it returns a value. Therefore there is no ternary operator (condition ? then : else), because ordinary if works fine in this role.  
- For Example  
// Traditional usage   
```
var max = a   
if (a < b) max = b  
  
// With else   
var max: Int  
if (a > b) {  
    max = a  
} else {  
    max = b  
}  
```   
- As expression   
```val max = if (a > b) a else b```
- if branches can be blocks, and the last expression is the value of a block:  
```
val max = if (a > b) {  
    print("Choose a")  
    a  
} else {  
    print("Choose b")  
    b  
}  
```
- **NOTE - If you're using if as an expression rather than a statement (for example, returning its value or assigning it to a variable), the expression is required to have an else branch. **  
  
## WHEN  
- When replace the switch statement of java. Now spm.kotlin.world.when is more flexible and more powerful as compared to Switch.
- Using **when** we can also compare more than one condition in one case
- Instead of switch case we use spm.kotlin.world.when clause in kotlin. When is more powerful and dynamic in nature as compared to switch. We can declare multiple conditions in one case. The syntax is as follows
```  
when(value){
case 1 ->{
}
case 2->{
}
else{
// this is nothing but the default condition in switch case
}} 
```
- Example  
```
when(a){
in 1..10 ->{
print(" $a is in the range 1 to 10")
}

a is String ->{
print(" $a is a string")
}
else {
print(" none of the above condition")
}
}  
```  
- One more example with return type.  
```
fun describe(obj: Any): String =  
    when (obj) {
        1          -> "One"  
        "Hello"    -> "Greeting"  
        is Long    -> "Long"  
        !is String -> "Not a string"  
        else       -> "Unknown"  
    }  
```      
- this spm.kotlin.world.when clause will return a string.
  
## For Example 
- 
```
when (x) {
    1 -> print("x == 1")  
    2 -> print("x == 2")  
    else -> { // Note the block  
        print("x is neither 1 nor 2")  
    }  
}
   when (x) {
    0, 1 -> print("x == 0 or x == 1")  
    else -> print("otherwise")  
}    
```  
- We can use arbitrary expressions (not only constants) as branch conditions  
```
when (x) {
    parseInt(s) -> print("s encodes x")  
    else -> print("s does not encode x")  
}    
```  
- We can also check a value for being in or !in a range or a collection:  
```
when (x) {
    in 1..10 -> print("x is in the range")
    in validNumbers -> print("x is valid")
    !in 10..20 -> print("x is outside the range")
    else -> print("none of the above")
}
```   
## For Loops 
- for loop iterates through anything that provides an iterator. This is equivalent to the foreach loop in languages like C#. The syntax is as follows:    
- ```for (item in collection) print(item)``` 
- The body can be a block. 
```
for (item: Int in ints) {  
    // ...  
}  
```  
- You can use range operator    
```
for (i in 1..3) {  
    println(i)  
} 
```
- You can use reverse and step as well
```
for (i in 6 downTo 0 step 2) {  
    println(i)  
}   
  
//sampleStart  
for (i in array.indices) {  
    println(array[i])  
} 
```
- You can iterate index and value of a array
```
val array = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")  
//sampleStart  
for ((index, value) in array.withIndex()) {  
    println("the element at $index is $value")  
}  
```  
## Return And Jumps
- **return** By default returns from the nearest enclosing spm.kotlin.world.function or anonymous function.
- **break** Terminates the nearest enclosing loop.  
- **continue** Proceeds to the next step of the nearest enclosing loop.  

## Break and Continue Labels
```  
loop@ for (i in 1..100) {  
    for (j in 1..100) {  
        if (...) break@loop  
    }  
}    
```  
- Labeled break 
```
fun foo() {  
    listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach lit@{  
        if (it == 3) return@lit // local return to the caller of the lambda, i.e. the forEach loop  
        print(it)  
    }  
    print(" done with explicit label")  
} 
```
