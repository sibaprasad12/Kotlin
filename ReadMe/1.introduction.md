# Kotlin introduction
- Example from **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEqhzCFmEQI&list=PLlxmoA0rQ-LwgK1JsnMsakYNACYGa1cjR&index=1**
## What is kotlin
- It's a statically typed language
- It is a JVM language
- It needs java virtual machine to execute its bytecode.
- It's fully interoperable with java
- Support to avoid NullPointer exception
- Supports immutability
- Object-oriented Language
- Functional
    - You can pass a function as parameter to another function
    - Or, a function can return another function
- Less ceremony
    - No more boilerplate
    - Less code, more result
    - Code looks clean

## Evolution of Kotlin
- Started in july 2011
- Stable version February 2016
## Types of apps that can be built using Kotlin
- Serverside apps ( SpringBoot, Vert.x, JFX, ktor )
- Android Development
- Web development(Kotlin JS)
- Desktop Application ( Java FX, TornadoTX )
- Native Development  ( Kotlin/Native Library )
## Installation and setup
- Install Jdk
- Download intelJ idea and start using kotlin in the IDE

## Hello World
- Create a kotlin file
- Write
```
fun main(args: Array<String>){
  print("spm.kotlin.world.basic.Hello World")
}
```

- Java demands class files
- Kotlin needs JVM in runtime similar to java
- Does Kotlin create a class internally ?
    - Yes, The kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime
- Once you will execute the kotlin file, it will create a .class file internally
- It will save inside out/production/project name/ filenamekt.class
- It's a compile code which is auto generated

## Quick Overview Of Basic Syntax
- Functions
- Variables
- Class
- Constructors
- Comments

## Advantage of Kotlin Over Java
- Kotlin is more flexible than java
- Kotlin is concise - means we can perform more task with less code
- It is more safety than Java - Because of it's Immutability of class and its Nullability Check we will not get null pointer
  exception
- Ensure More performance
- Supports high order function, we can pass function as method parameter
- Kotlin and java are interpolate
- Kotlin is similar to Scripting language, it's the next generation language

## How Java works
- TestClass.java is compiled by javac (Java compiler).
- Javac compiles Java source file into Java byte-code file as TestClass.class.
- Java byte-code file (TestClass.class) ends up in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- JVM understands byte-code and converts it into machine code, using JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
- The machine code is then feed to the memory and executed by computer central processing unit.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** — engine which provides runtime environment for execution of Java code.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** — type of compiler which does the compilation during the execution of a program (compiles the app when user opens it).

## How Kotlin works
- .kt file is compiled by Kotlin compiler
- It creates .class file which is nothing, but the byte code which is interpreted by JVM
- That byte code executed by JVM
- For more details, here is the image below

- **Does kotlin create a class internally ?**
- Yes, The kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime.
- Let's create a spm.kotlin.world.basic.Hello.kt kotlin file and while executing it convert to Hellokt.class file to execute the class file by
  JVM

## How Hello World Program Works
- in kotlin
```
    fun main(args:Array<String>){
        println("spm.kotlin.world.basic.Hello")
    }
``` 

- It don't have class define, but it executes perfectly. The Kotlin Compiler creates a class file which is loaded
  into memory at runtime.
- During compile time, Kotlin compiler convert the MyClass.kt file to MyClasskt
  Once we run the class , MyClasskt.class file will be generate by java runtime

 ```
 print(10/9)  output = 1
 print(10.0/9)  output is 1.1223
 ```
