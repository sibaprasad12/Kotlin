# Kotlin introduction
## **Advantage of Kotlin Over Java**  
- Kotlin is more flexible than java  
- Kotlin is concise - means we can perform more task with less code  
- Its More safety than Java -  Because its Immutablility of class and its Nullablity Check
we will not get null pointer exception  
- Ensure More performance
- Supports high order spm.kotlin.world.function, we can pass spm.kotlin.world.function as method parameter
- Kotlin and java are interpoble
- Kotlin is similar to Scripting language, its the next generation language 
 

## How Java works
- TestClass.java is compiled by javac (Java compiler).
- Javac compiles Java source file into Java byte-code file as TestClass.class.
- Java byte-code file (TestClass.class) ends up in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- JVM understands byte-code and converts it into machine code, using JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
- The machine code is then feed to the memory and executed by computer central processing unit.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** — engine which provides runtime environment for execution of Java code.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** — type of compiler which does the compilation during the execution of a program (compiles the app when user opens it).
## How Kotlin works
- .kt file is compiled by Kotlin compiler
- It creates .class file which is nothing but the byte code which is intepreted by JVM
- That byte code executed by JVM
- For more details, here is the image below

- **Does kotlin creates a class internally ?**
- Yes, The kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime.
- Lets create a Hello.kt kotlin file and while executing it convert to Hellokt.class file to execute the class file by JVM
- 


## How Hello World Program Works
- in kotlin
```
fun main(args:Array<String>){
 println("Hello")
 }
``` 
- It dont have class define, but it executes perfectly. The Kotlin Compiler creates a class  file which is loaded intomemory at runtime.  
 During compile time, Kotlin compiler convert the Myclass.kt file to MyClasskt  
 Once we run the class , MyClasskt.class file will be generate by java runtime  
 ```
 print(10/9)  output = 1
 print(10.0/9)  output is 1.1223
 ```
