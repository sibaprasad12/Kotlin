# Kotlin Interview Questions- What is Kotlin ?  - - How it works internally ?  - - What are extension functions in Kotlin?  - - What is null safety?  -- Is there a ternary operator like in Java ?    - No, there isn’t, but what a ternary operator does can be achieved through an if-else expression.- What’s the difference between val and var in Kotlin?    - A: Both are used for declaring a variable. However, while val is a final variable that is immutable and can be      initialized only once, var is a general variable that can be assigned multiple times.- What are the basic data types in Kotlin?    - A: Numbers, characters, Booleans, arrays, and strings.- How many constructors are there in Kotlin?    - A: A constructor’s main role is to initialize the properties of a class. In Kotlin, there can be a primary      constructor and one or more secondary constructors.- What are the extension methods that Kotlin provides to the Java.io file list?    - A:      bufferedReader():read contents of a file to BufferedReader readBytes() : read contents of a file to ByteArray      readText(): read contents of a file to a single String forEachLine() : read a file line by line in Kotlin      readLines(): read lines in a file to List- What are the structural expressions in Kotlin?A: There are three structural expressions:Return: helps to return from the closest function or an anonymous function. Break:  helps to terminate the closestenclosing loop. Continue: helps proceed to the next step of the closest enclosing loop.- What is the difference between const and val?    - A: Const is a keyword used to define compile-time constants, while val is used to define runtime constants.- Is it possible to migrate code from Java to Kotlin?    - A : Yes, it is. IntelliJ IDEA is a tool that can help you do that.- What are data classes in Kotlin?    - A data class is similar to a regular class with certain additional functionalities.    - For example, in order to store data items in Java, it’s necessary to create a class by setting the variables.    - In Kotlin, all it takes is adding keyword data to the class, and the compiler will automatically generate a      default getter and setter. So, basically, there’s no need to write or generate the extensive boilerplate code.- What modifiers are available in Kotlin?- Kotlin offers four visibility modifiers:  Private: visible inside this class and all its members only. Protected: the same as private, but visible in subclasses  too. Internal: visible inside the same module Public: by default, all the declarations are visible to everyone.- What is a string in Kotlin?    - A:  It’s a basic data type. Strings are immutable and Kotlin has two types of string literals:  Raw strings, which are delimited by a triple quote and can contain newlines, arbitrary text, and any other  character.     Escaped strings, which handle special characters by escaping them.- hat is the Init Block?    - A: It’s the initializer block and the code inside of it is executed when the primary constructor is instantiated.- Is new a keyword in Kotlin?    - A: No, it’s not and it doesn’t have to be used to instantiate a class.- Are there primitives in Kotlin?    - In a nutshell, there are no out-of-the-box primitives in Kotlin – they can’t be created at a code level. Given      that Kotlin has been designed to cooperate with Java and the JVM seamlessly, certain types like int or float can      act like primitives in certain cases.- Is there an equivalent for switch in Kotlin?    - A: Yes, there is. The When keyword is used instead.- What are deconstructing declarations?    - A: Kotlin comes with a functionality that allows developers to assign multiple values to variables. This kind of      syntax allows for creating multiple variables that can be used independently at once.
