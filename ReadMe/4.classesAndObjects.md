# Classes And Objects

## Classes and Objects

A class in Kotlin can have a primary constructor and one or more secondary constructors. The primary constructor is part
of the class header: it goes after the class name (and optional type parameters).

```
class Person constructor(firstName: String) {  
} 
```

**NOTE**  
**If the primary constructor does not have any annotations or visibility modifiers, the constructor keyword can be
omitted.**

```
class Person(firstName: String) {  
} 
```

**NOTE-** The primary constructor cannot contain any code. Initialization code can be placed in initializer blocks,
which are prefixed with the init keyword.

**Secondary Constructors**  
The class can also declare secondary constructors, which are prefixed with constructor:

```
class Person {  
    constructor(parent: Person) {  
        parent.children.add(this)  
        }  
    }
```

**NOTE** If the class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to delegate to the primary
constructor, either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor(s). Delegation to another constructor
of the same class is done using the this keyword:

```   
class Person(val name: String) {   
    constructor(name: String, parent: Person) : this(name) {  
        parent.children.add(this)  
    }  
}  
```

- **NOTE:Note that code in initializer blocks effectively becomes part of the primary constructor**
- **NOTE-** If you want to declare a constructor as private , then u can declare as below

```
class DontCreateMe private constructor () {  

} 
```

- **NOTE:** you can declare constructor with defalut parameters,  
  class Customer(val customerName: String = "SIbaprasad"){  
  init{  
  println(customerName)
  } } in the above case, if we will not pass any value to the constructor, it will assign the default value  
  var cons = Customer()// it will print SIbaprasad  
  var cons = Customer("Mohanty")// it will print Mohanty

**Class Members**  
Classes can contain:  
  
1) Constructors and initializer blocks  
2) Functions  
3) Properties  
4) Nested and Inner Classes  
5) Object Declarations  
  
## Inheritance  
All classes in Kotlin have a common superclass Any, that is the default superclass for a class with no supertypes declared:   
class Example // Implicitly inherits from Any   
  
**Note:** Any is not java.lang.Object; in particular, it does not have any members other than equals(), hashCode() and toString(). Please consult the Java interoperability section for more details.  
  
**NOTE : The open annotation on a class is the opposite of Java's final:**
open class Base(p: Int)  
  
class Derived(p: Int) : Base(p)  
  
**NOTE:** If the derived class has a primary constructor, the base class can (and must) be initialized right there, using the parameters of the primary constructor.  
  
If the class has no primary constructor, then each secondary constructor has to initialize the base type using the super keyword, or to delegate to another constructor which does that. Note that in this case different secondary constructors can call different constructors of the base type:    
  
class MyView : View {  
    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx)  
  
    constructor(ctx: Context, attrs: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attrs)  
}    
    
  
**Overriding Methods**  
  
As we mentioned before, we stick to making things explicit in Kotlin. And unlike Java, Kotlin requires explicit annotations for overridable members (we call them open) and for overrides:  
  
open class Base {  
    open fun v() {}  
    fun nv() {}  
}  
class Derived() : Base() {  
    override fun v() {}  
}
